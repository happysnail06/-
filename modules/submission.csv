0,Does hormone therapy affect attention and memory in sleep-deprived women?,1. The study was performed to evaluate whether hormone therapy (HT) modifies cognitive performance during sleep deprivation in postmenopausal women.,"['To evaluate whether hormone therapy (HT) modifies cognitive performance during sleep deprivation in postmenopausal women. Comparison was made with a group of young women.', 'Participants included 26 postmenopausal women (age 58-72 years, 16 HT users, 10 non-users), 11 young women (age 20-26 years). They spent four consecutive nights in the sleep laboratory. Cognitive tests of attention, working memory, and verbal episodic memory were carried out after the baseline night, 25-h sleep deprivation, and recovery night.', 'We found that, compared with healthy women, women with breast cancer had poorer memory (P = 0.05) and attention (P = 0.006). Controlling for the covariates age and estimated verbal intelligence, we found that factors related to greater lifetime hormone exposure (oral contraceptive use, greater years since menopause, and longer duration of hormone therapy) predicted cognitive function (executive function, verbal learning and memory, attention, psychomotor efficiency, and visual sustained attention) in women with and without breast cancer but did not explain the differences in cognitive function observed at pretreatment in women with breast cancer.', 'Sleep deprivation impaired performance in all groups. It was manifested either as delayed practice effect or deteriorated performance (p<0.05). In simple reaction time and 10-choice reaction time, non-users and young maintained their performance, whereas HT users suffered a minor impairment (p<0.01). In other measurements, there was no interaction of group and condition. In 10-choice reaction time and vigilance, postmenopausal women made fewer errors and omissions than the young (p<0.05). For most tasks, all groups showed improvement after one recovery night.', 'Postmenopausal women aged 50 to 65 years who did not use hormone therapy were recruited for the study. The sample included 14 women with insomnia and 12 women without insomnia or any other sleep disorder. The groups were comparable in age, schooling, and anxiety level. To assess mindfulness, we used the validated Mindful Attention Awareness Scale and the attentiveness domain of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule-Expanded Form.', 'To determine whether endogenous sex hormone levels are associated with cognitive functioning in men.', 'Sex steroids can positively affect the brain and from this it would follow that high levels of sex steroids could be associated with better cognitive function in older men and women.', 'In healthy older men and women, optimal levels of testosterone were associated with better MMSE scores at baseline. Follow-up analyses indicated that in men, low testosterone levels (OR=.94, 95% CI=.88 to 1.00) were a risk factor for a sharp cognitive decline after 2 years, perhaps indicative of dementia. Associations were independent of covariates and baseline MMSE. Conversely, women at risk for a sharp drop in cognitive function showed some evidence for higher calculated free testosterone levels at baseline.', 'This Healthy Ageing Study sample comprised of 521 older participants (51% women) without dementia at baseline, with an age range from 64 to 94 years. Testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin were measured using the automated Immulite 2000 and analyzed in association with baseline memory, global cognitive function and decline (assessed using the Mini-Mental Status Examination or MMSE) and controlling for potential confounds such as age, education, vascular disease, smoking, diabetes, thyroid function, and body mass index.', 'Cognitive performance was assessed in 400 independently living men between ages 40 and 80 in a population-based cross-sectional study. Compound scores were calculated for memory function, processing capacity/speed, and executive function. The Mini-Mental State Examination was used as a measure of global cognitive function. The adjusted association of testosterone (T) and estradiol (E2) (total, bioavailable) with neuropsychological test scores in the total group and in subgroups was assessed by linear and logistic regression analysis.']","Yes, hormone therapy does appear to affect attention and memory in sleep-deprived women. The study found that compared to non-users of hormone therapy, postmenopausal women who used hormone therapy experienced a minor impairment in simple reaction time and 10-choice reaction time during sleep deprivation. Additionally, factors related to greater lifetime hormone exposure, such as oral contraceptive use and longer duration of hormone therapy, were found to predict cognitive function in women with and without breast cancer. These results suggest that hormone therapy may influence cognitive performance during sleep deprivation in postmenopausal women."
1,Children in taxis: an opportunity for pediatricians and emergency physicians to save lives?,"1. The pediatric transport program of a children's hospital.

The context suggests a focus on pediatric emergency care and transportation, particularly in the context of motor vehicle collisions and other pediatric emergencies. Some key points:

1. The pediatric transport program of a children's hospital is mentioned, indicating an interest in how children are transported, especially in emergency situations.

2. The context discusses how a motor vehicle collision (MVC) may represent a ""teachable moment"" to increase booster seat use, suggesting a concern for child safety in vehicles.

3. The aim is to characterize ambulance utilization and pediatric emergency physicians' judgement of the need for ambulance transport, further highlighting the role of transportation in pediatric emergencies.

4. The objective is to assess preparedness to respond to pediatric emergencies, including the availability of resuscitation equipment, suggesting a focus on emergency care for children.

Given this context, the question ""Children in taxis: an opportunity for pediatricians and emergency physicians to save lives?"" could be interpreted as exploring whether taxis, as a mode of transportation for children, represent an opportunity for pediatricians and emergency physicians to intervene and promote safety measures (such as booster seats) that could help save lives in the event of a collision or other emergency. The question suggests examining taxi transport as a potential ""teachable moment"" for these healthcare providers."

Significant differences in the time spent per area of interest were observed between endoscopists. The measured total gaze time per area of interest correlated strongly with the time spent on the corresponding area of the colonic surface (Pearson correlation coefficients ranging between 0.91 and 0.97). Endoscopists with more years of colonoscopy experience showed significantly higher percentages of overlap between the measured gaze position in the different areas of interest and the actual inspected area of the colonic surface (r=0.65, P=0.02). More experienced endoscopists had nonsignificantly longer mean gaze times per area of interest (r=0.52, P=0.06).', 'In this pilot study, 10 endoscopists performed two colonoscopies each.

1. Significant differences were observed in the time spent per area of interest between endoscopists, indicating that gaze patterns can reveal differences in viewing behavior.

2. The measured gaze time per area of interest strongly correlated with the time spent on the corresponding area of the colonic surface, suggesting that gaze patterns are a good proxy for actual inspection of the colon.

3. Endoscopists with more years of colonoscopy experience showed higher overlap between their measured gaze position and the actual inspected area of the colonic surface. This implies that gaze tracking can help identify and potentially improve inspection patterns, especially for less experienced endoscopists.

4. The study was designed to investigate the feasibility of using eye-tracking technology during real-time colonoscopies, indicating that this approach is a viable method for evaluating colon inspection.

Overall, the context provided suggests that measuring gaze patterns during colonoscopy is a useful tool to objectively assess and potentially improve endoscopists' colon inspection performance, especially in the context of differences in adenoma detection rates between endoscopists."
5,Are exercise stress tests appropriate for assessing myocardial ischemia in patients with major depressive disorder?,"You are performing question-answering tasks. Your mission is to answer the given question using the provided context. Use the retrieved context to answer the question.

                Q: ```Are exercise stress tests appropriate for assessing myocardial ischemia in patients with major depressive disorder?```
                Context: ```Major depressive disorder (MDD) disproportionately affects patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Evidence of myocardial ischemia with electrocardiography (ECG) or single-photon-emission-computed-tomography (SPECT) assessments during exercise testing is an important determinant of CAD prognosis. However, many key symptoms of MDD, such as reduced interest in daily activities, lack of energy, and fatigue, may affect exercise performance and the detection of ischemia in patients with MDD. This study evaluated the extent to which MDD and depressive symptomatology moderate exercise test performance and compared the ability of ECG versus SPECT for detecting ischemia in 1367 consecutive patients who underwent exercise testing. A total of 2342 patients (women n=760) completed a single photon emission computed tomographic exercise stress test (standard Bruce Protocol) and underwent a psychiatric interview (The Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders) to assess mood and anxiety disorders. Ischemia was assessed using single photon emission computed tomography, with odds ratio used to calculate the effect of sex and mood/anxiety on the presence of ischemia during stress testing by CAD history in a stratified analyses, adjusted for relevant covariates. There was a sex by anxiety interaction with ischemia in those without a CAD history (P=0.015): women with anxiety were more likely to exhibit ischemia during exercise than women without anxiety (odds ratio, 1.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-2.89). No significant effects were observed for men nor mood. Retrospective analysis of the associations between exercise-induced ST-segment depression and a history of hypertension, exercise systolic BP, and several other clinical and exercise test variables. Among 20,097 patients referred for exercise tomographic thallium imaging in a nuclear cardiology laboratory at a tertiary care center, 1,873 patients met inclusion criteria for this study, which included no history of myocardial infarction or coronary artery revascularization, a normal resting ECG, and normal exercise thallium images. We evaluated 117 patients (mean age, 63 +/- 9 years) with ischemic ST-segment depression during treadmill testing. Each patient underwent Tl-201 myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) after exercise followed by 24-ambulatory ECG monitoring. Patients were divided into silent versus symptomatic cohorts and were compared for the degree of hemodynamic, exercise and ambulatory ECG, and thallium abnormalities during stress testing. Analyses were repeated as the patient population became increasingly restricted. Compared with the silent patients, patients with chest pain during exercise had a shorter exercise duration (P<.009), lower peak heart rate (P = .009) and double product (P = .005), lower heart rate threshold for ST depression (P<.05), more episodes of ambulatory ST-segment depression (P<.05), a higher frequency of ischemia abnormalities during Tl-201 SPECT (P = .02), and higher summed Tl reversibility scores (P = .002). As the population became increasingly restricted, the relative magnitude of differences in silent versus symptomatic cohorts diminished, whereas the absolute magnitude of ischemic abnormalities progressively increased in both cohorts. For example, within the restricted group having ischemia on both exercise and ambulatory ECG, 50% of the silent cohort had severe ischemia on Tl SPECT (five or more reversible defects) and more than one third demonstrated the ominous finding of transient left ventricular dilation after exercise. In patients with functional limitations, the use of adjunctive exercise with vasodilator stress has advantages over vasodilator stress alone in single photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) for technical reasons and with regards to more effective cardiac risk stratification. Whether patients who undergo vasodilator with exercise MPI are at higher risk for cardiac events than those who undergo vasodilator MPI alone is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the use of exercise with vasodilator MPI increases the risk of cardiac events in patients with functional limitations. We identified 1,000 consecutive patients who underwent vasodilator MPI with and without exercise stress from January 2000 to December 2009. Patients were followed up for 5 years. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and urgent revascularization. The use of exercise with vasodilator MPI was not associated with a higher risk of cardiac events (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.76-1.42; P = .80). The use of exercise with vasodilator MPI was associated with a higher prevalence of ischemia (72% vs 56%; P < .001) and a higher prevalence of multivessel disease (38% vs 26%; P < .001). The use of exercise with vasodilator MPI was associated with a higher prevalence of ischemia and a higher prevalence of multivessel disease, but was not associated with a higher risk of cardiac events. The use of exercise with vasodilator MPI in patients with functional limitations is safe and may provide additional diagnostic information.

Therefore, additional considerations and alternative methods may need to be taken into account when evaluating myocardial ischemia in patients with MDD."
6,Cannabis use and other predictors of the onset of daily cigarette use in young men: what matters most?,1. Cannabis use remained among the strongest predictors for the onset of daily cigarette use.,"['In the multivariate overall model, use of cannabis remained among the strongest predictors for the onset of daily cigarette use. Daily cigarette use was also predicted by a lifetime use of at least 50 cigarettes, occasional cigarette use, educational level, religious affiliation, parental situation, peers with psychiatric problems, and sociability.', 'According to the gateway hypothesis, tobacco use is a gateway of cannabis use. However, there is increasing evidence that cannabis use also predicts the progression of tobacco use (reverse gateway hypothesis). Unfortunately, the importance of cannabis use compared to other predictors of tobacco use is less clear. The aim of this study was to examine which variables, in addition to cannabis use, best predict the onset of daily cigarette smoking in young men.', 'We examine whether regular cigarette smokers were more likely to be exposed to and use cannabis at an earlier age, and further, upon initiation, whether their initial experiences with cannabis varied from those reported by never/non-regular cigarette smokers.', ""We retain 8 variables to predict the risk of smoking and 6 to predict the quantities smoked by smokers. The risk of being a smoker is increased by cannabis use, binge drinking, being unsupportive of smoke-free universities, perceived friends' approval of regular smoking, positive perceptions about tobacco, a high perceived prevalence of smoking among friends, reporting not being disturbed by people smoking in the university, and being female. The quantity of cigarettes smoked by smokers is greater for smokers reporting never being disturbed by smoke in the university, unsupportive of smoke-free universities, perceiving that their friends approve of regular smoking, having more negative beliefs about the tobacco industry, being sociology students and being among the older students."", 'Regular cigarette smokers were more likely to report an earlier opportunity to use cannabis and early onset of cannabis use. Regular cigarette smokers were also considerably more likely to have enjoyed their first experience with cannabis and reported higher rates of positive initial reactions. They were more likely to report inhaling on the first try and smoking cigarettes with cannabis. Potentially negative subjective reactions were also elevated in regular cigarette smokers. Importantly, cigarette smokers were at 1.87 increased odds of smoking cannabis within a week of their initial use.', 'To investigate whether cannabis use predicted the first incidence of mood and anxiety disorders in adults during a 3-year follow-up period.', ""After adjustment for strong confounders, any use of cannabis at baseline predicted a modest increase in the risk of a first major depression (odds ratio 1.62; 95% confidence interval 1.06-2.48) and a stronger increase in the risk of a first bipolar disorder (odds ratio 4.98; 95% confidence interval 1.80-13.81).

It is among the strongest predictors, along with other factors such as lifetime use of at least 50 cigarettes, occasional cigarette use, educational level, religious affiliation, parental situation, peers with psychiatric problems, and sociability.

While the gateway hypothesis traditionally suggests that tobacco use leads to cannabis use, there is evidence supporting the reverse gateway hypothesis, indicating that cannabis use can also predict the progression of tobacco use. In this study, cannabis use seems to play a crucial role in predicting the onset of daily cigarette smoking in young men compared to other factors. Additionally, regular cigarette smokers were more likely to have early exposure to and positive experiences with cannabis, highlighting the importance of cannabis use in the initiation of cigarette smoking."

                Q: ```Threshold levels in food challenge and specific IgE in patients with egg allergy: is there a relationship?```
                Context: ```Previously published articles described a relationship between food-specific IgE and the outcome of food challenge in children with egg allergy. These investigations defined different levels of predictive values in different study populations and thus pointed toward the possibility of a certain level of specific IgE to egg white predicting a positive outcome in food challenge. The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of specific IgE in estimating threshold level to predict a positive outcome in food challenge. Decreased serum food-specific IgA antibodies have been associated with allergic disease in cross-sectional, case-control studies. The purpose of this study was to prospectively compare egg-white-(EW)-specific IgA and IgA2 levels between egg-allergic children and children tolerating egg. Fifty-six children were evaluated for egg allergy by titrated oral challenges. Sera were analyzed for specific IgE to egg white in 56 patients by using the Magic Lite test and 32 of 56 patients also by the CAP test. Values of specific IgE to egg white were compared to the outcome of challenges and the threshold level. In 395 children referred to our clinic with suspected cow's milk allergy and in 268 children with suspected hen's egg allergy specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) was measured, a SPT and an oral food challenge performed. A weal size ≥ 3 mm and sIgE ≥ 0.35 kU/L were considered positive. The weal size of the SPT and the level of food-specific IgE were tested for correlation for each allergen. Out of 258 patients 166(64.37%) had raised serum total IgE levels (108 males and 92 females). Among host factors there was no significant association of serum total IgE levels with age, sex, height of the patient, positive family history of allergy or age at which symptoms developed (p =or>0.05), though the correlation of serum total IgE levels was seen with weight of the patient (p<0.049), early weaning (p<0.01) and bottle feeding (p<0.01) in children. Among environmental factors serum total IgE levels had a strong association with exposure to passive smoking (p<0.01), pollen (p<0.01), cold (p<0.01), and pets (p<0.01).

2. The fourth paragraph describes that ""A total of 381 BPH patients with intermediate PSA (4.1-10 ng/ml) and prior negative sextant biopsy underwent extended 11-core biopsy, which included conventional sextant biopsy in addition to five cores from three alternative sites.""

Therefore, the context indicates that the extended 11-core biopsy was performed in the target population of BPH patients with intermediate PSA levels and prior negative sextant biopsy, suggesting it is a valuable approach in this clinical scenario."

Abnormal (absent or reduced) oto-acoustic emission was detected in 77 of 102 ears (41 of 51 patients) in the HSCR group and 8 out of 48 ears (6 of 24 children) in the control group (75% v 17%; P<.0001). Two HSCR children had marked abnormalities on tests of peripheral nerve function. Significantly higher thresholds for vibration sensation were detected in HSCR versus controls (P<.05).

                Context: ```Given the benefits of radiographic cephalometric studies in determining patterns of dental-skeletal-facial normality in orthodontics, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between mandibular dental arch shape and cross-sectional and vertical facial measurements. To investigate whether individuals with high and low mandibular plane angles, respectively, have different patterns of long-term dental arch changes in adulthood. It was analyzed plaster casts and teleradiographs in frontal and lateral norm belonging to 50 individuals, aged between 15 and 19 years, with no previous history of orthodontic treatment and falling into four of the six Andrews's occlusion keys. The plaster models were scanned (3D) and the images of the dental arches were classified subjectively as oval, triangular and quadrangular by three calibrated examiners, with moderate inter-examiner agreement (Kappa = 0.50). After evaluation of the method error by paired t test (p>0.05), it was carried out the analysis of cross-sectional and vertical facial measurements to be compared to the shape of the dental arch. Data were subjected to one-way analysis of variance with a significance level of 5%. The main outcome measures for the original study were craniofacial form, dental arch relationships, nasolabial appearance, and speech. This report focuses on measurements of anterior maxillary arch depth and palate height. When the VERT index was compared with the three arch shapes, no measurement showed statistically significant differences (p>0.05): triangular (0.54); oval (0.43); and quadrangular (0.73); as well as there were no differences (p>0.05) in the widths of the face (141.20; 141.26; 143.27); maxilla (77.27; 77.57; 78.59) and mandible (105.13; 103.96; 104.28).

                Q: ```Do Alu repeats drive the evolution of the primate transcriptome?```
                Context: ```Of all repetitive elements in the human genome, Alus are unusual in being enriched near to genes that are expressed across a broad range of tissues. This has led to the proposal that Alus might be modifying the expression breadth of neighboring genes, possibly by providing CpG islands, modifying transcription factor binding, or altering chromatin structure. Here we consider whether Alus have increased expression breadth of genes in their vicinity. Contrary to the modification hypothesis, we find that those genes that have always had broad expression are richest in Alus, whereas those that are more likely to have become more broadly expressed have lower enrichment. This finding is consistent with a model in which Alus accumulate near broadly expressed genes but do not affect their expression breadth. Furthermore, this model is consistent with the finding that expression breadth of mouse genes predicts Alu density near their human orthologs. However, Alus were found to be related to some alternative measures of transcription profile divergence, although evidence is contradictory as to whether Alus associate with lowly or highly diverged genes. If Alu have any effect it is not by provision of CpG islands, because they are especially rare near to transcriptional start sites. Previously reported Alu enrichment for genes serving certain cellular functions, suggested to be evidence of functional importance of Alus, appears to be partly a byproduct of the association with broadly expressed genes. We studied five mitochondrial genes in the monocot order Alismatales, all showing marked differences in editing frequencies among taxa. A general tendency to lose edited sites was observed in all taxa, but this tendency was particularly strong in two clades, with most of the edited sites lost in parallel in two different areas of the phylogeny. This pattern is observed in at least four of the five genes analyzed. Except in the groups that show an unusually low editing frequency, the rate of C-to-T changes in edited sites was not significantly higher that in non-edited 3rd codon positions. This may indicate that selection is not actively removing edited sites in nine of the 12 families of the core Alismatales. In all genes but ccmB, a significant correlation was found between frequency of change in edited sites and synonymous substitution rate. In general, taxa with higher substitution rates tend to have fewer edited sites, as indicated by the phylogenetically independent correlation analyses. The elimination of edited sites in groups that lack or have reduced levels of editing could be a result of gene conversion involving a cDNA copy (retroprocessing). If so, this phenomenon could be relatively common in the Alismatales, and may have affected some groups recurrently. Indirect evidence of retroprocessing without a necessary correlation with substitution rate was found mostly in families Alismataceae and Hydrocharitaceae (e.g., groups that suffered a rapid elimination of all their edited sites, without a change in substitution rate). Here, we show that the hypermutability of CpG dinucleotides, rather than the natural selection against the nullomer sequences, is likely the reason for the phenomenal event of short sequence motifs becoming nullomers. Furthermore, many reported human nullomers differ by only one nucleotide, which reinforces the role of mutation in the evolution of the constellation of nullomers in populations and species. The known nullomers in chimpanzee, cow, dog, and mouse genomes show patterns that are consistent with those seen in humans. In plant mitochondria, the post-transcriptional RNA editing process converts C to U at a number of specific sites of the mRNA sequence and usually restores phylogenetically conserved codons and the encoded amino acid residues. Sites undergoing RNA editing evolve at a higher rate than sites not modified by the process. As a result, editing sites strongly affect the evolution of plant mitochondrial genomes, representing an important source of sequence variability and potentially informative characters. To date no clear and convincing evidence has established whether or not editing sites really affect the topology of reconstructed phylogenetic trees. For this reason, we investigated here the effect of RNA editing on the tree building process of twenty different plant mitochondrial gene sequences and by means of computer simulations.

The known nullomers in chimpanzee, cow, dog, and mouse genomes show patterns that are consistent with those seen in humans.', 'In plant mitochondria, the post-transcriptional RNA editing process converts C to U at a number of specific sites of the mRNA sequence and usually restores phylogenetically conserved codons and the encoded amino acid residues. Sites undergoing RNA editing evolve at a higher rate than sites not modified by the process. As a result, editing sites strongly affect the evolution of plant mitochondrial genomes, representing an important source of sequence variability and potentially informative characters. To date no clear and convincing evidence has established whether or not editing sites really affect the topology of reconstructed phylogenetic trees. For this reason, we investigated here the effect of RNA editing on the tree building process of twenty different plant mitochondrial gene sequences and by means of computer simulations.', 'Title: Human core duplicon gene families: game changers or game players?\nPassage: The RANBP2 protein encoded by the progenitor gene is primarily localized within the periphery of the nuclear envelope and is thought to be required for cargo import and export . Hence, the RGPD gene family members may be modifiers of this function. Interestingly, RANBP2 was also shown to be involved in resistance against Simian Immunodeficiency Virus . It is thus possible that the expansion of RGPD genes is the result of an arms race between virus evolution and host resistance acquisition. The Ranbp2 knockout in mice is homozygous lethal.', 'Title: Species-specific vulnerability of RanBP2 shaped the evolution of SIV as it transmitted in African apes\nPassage: As summarized in Table 1 , RanBP2 seems to be generally important for nuclear import of HIV-1 and HIV-2, but so far there is less evidence that it is important for SIVs from monkeys. We next tested whether great ape SIVs are dependent on RanBP2 for optimal entry. We used a lentiviral shRNA system to knockdown RanBP2 in 293T cells . The knockdown of RanBP2 is known to be toxic to cells , so we tested three different RanBP2 shRNA constructs for their general effect on cell proliferation using an MTT assay .

The question of whether these proteins participate directly in the initiation event or facilitate recruitment of key initiation factors to the expanded repeats still needs to be answered.', 'Title: Species-specific vulnerability of RanBP2 shaped the evolution of SIV as it transmitted in African apes\nPassage: Introduction RanBP2 is the major constituent of the cytoplasmic filaments extruding from the mammalian nuclear pore complex, where it mediates cargo import and export . Depletion of RanBP2 negatively affects HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection and nuclear import . Although HIV-1 can use other redundant pathways for import, pathways not involving RanBP2 lead to suboptimal chromosomal integration sites for the HIV-1 genome . The interaction between RanBP2 and HIV-1 may not occur strictly at the nuclear pore. It was recently reported that the Kinesin-1 motor, KIF5B, relocalizes RanBP2 to the cytoplasm during infection . As summarized in Table 1 , RanBP2']","Based on the context provided, the evidence suggests that Alu repeats do not drive the evolution of the primate transcriptome. The key points are:

1. Contrary to the hypothesis that Alu repeats modify the expression breadth of neighboring genes, the data shows that genes with broad expression are richest in Alu repeats, while genes that become more broadly expressed have lower Alu enrichment. This suggests Alu repeats accumulate near broadly expressed genes rather than driving increased expression breadth.

2. The expression breadth of mouse genes predicts the Alu density near their human orthologs, further supporting the idea that Alu distribution is a consequence of gene expression breadth, not a driver of it.

3. The evidence on the relationship between Alu repeats and transcription profile divergence is contradictory, with some studies suggesting Alu association with lowly diverged genes and others with highly diverged genes. 

4. The enrichment of Alu repeats near genes with certain functions appears to be a byproduct of their association with broadly expressed genes, rather than Alus driving functional specialization.

In summary, the context provided does not support the idea that Alu repeats are a major driver of transcriptome evolution in primates. The data indicates Alu distribution is more a consequence of existing gene expression patterns rather than a cause of transcriptome changes."

                Q: ```Is dyslipidemia sustained during remission of nephrotic syndrome genetically determined?```
                Context: ```The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of the genetic polymorphisms of proteins involved in lipoprotein metabolism on persistent abnormal lipid profile in patients with nephrotic syndrome during remission. In same patients lipid profile disturbances persist during nephrotic syndrome remission. 50 patients aged between 5.8 and 16.6 years (mean age 10.45 +/- 3.04) with nephrotic syndrome in remission of at least 8 weeks' duration, including 12 steroid-resistant and 38 steroid-dependent cases, participated in the study. We evalauated associations between lipid profile and genetic polymorphisms, V771M, V8251, and R1587K of the gene encoding the cassette ABCA1 (adenosine triphosphate binding cassette transporter A1) protein synthesis, a E3 polymorphism of the gene encoding the type upsilon of apolipoprotein E (apoE) synthesis and that of the gene encoding the cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) synthesis. To examine whether a family history of dyslipidemia influences the lipid-lipoprotein response to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet). Patients with nephrotic syndrome have the highest lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations known. Lp(a) is an low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-like particle consisting of 45% cholesterol. The usual methods to determine LDL cholesterol do not distinguish between cholesterol derived from LDL and Lp(a) and are thus the net result of cholesterol levels from both lipoproteins. High Lp(a) concentrations therefore significantly contribute to the measured or calculated LDL cholesterol levels. Since statins have no influence on Lp(a) levels, it can be expected that the LDL cholesterol-lowering effect of statins may be diminished in patients who have a pronounced elevation of Lp(a) levels accompanied by only moderate elevations of LDL cholesterol. Because of the contradictory reports concerning rapamycin on proteinuria, we examined proteinuria and podocyte damage markers on two renal disease models, with clearly different pathophysiological mechanisms: a glomerular toxico-immunological model induced by puromycin aminonucleoside, and a chronic hyperfiltration and inflammatory model by mass reduction, both treated with a fixed high rapamycin dose. In puromycin groups, rapamycin provoked significant increases in proteinuria, together with a significant fall in podocin immunofluorescence, as well as clear additional damage to podocyte foot processes. Conversely, after mass reduction, rapamycin produced lower levels of proteinuria and amelioration of inflammatory and pro-fibrotic damage. In contrast to the puromycin model, higher glomerular podocin and nephrin expression and amelioration of glomerular ultrastructural damage were found. In clinical renal transplantation, an increase in proteinuria after conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to rapamycin has been reported. In contrast, there are studies showing a nephro-protective effect of rapamycin in proteinuric diseases characterized by progressive interstitial inflammatory fibrosis. To evaluate whether restricting protein intake may delay the progression of chronic renal failure caused by overt diabetic nephropathy and also whether this increases the risk of malnutrition. Proteinuria and dyslipidemia are nonimmune risk factors implicated in the deterioration of kidney function and associated with an increased risk of accelerated atherogenesis. Statin therapy, used for cholesterol reduction, has shown a renoprotective effect in animal models, particularly in cases of proteinuria. This may occur through lipid-independent mechanisms, such as improved endothelial dysfunction/vascular biology, reduced inflammatory cytokine production (transforming growth factor-beta 1 [TGF-β1] and interleukin-6 [IL-6]), and reduced oxidative stress. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of a low-protein diet on the progression of chronic renal failure and the incidence of malnutrition in patients with diabetic nephropathy. The study included 100 patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic renal failure (CRF) with overt diabetic nephropathy. The patients were divided into two groups: the first group received a low-protein diet (n = 50) and the second group received a control diet (n = 50). The low-protein diet consisted of 0.6 g/kg/day and the control diet consisted of 1.0 g/kg/day. The study lasted 12 months. The low-protein diet was associated with a significant reduction in proteinuria and a significant increase in the serum albumin level. The incidence of malnutrition was significantly lower in the low-protein diet group than in the control group. The low-protein diet was associated with a significant reduction in the serum cholesterol level and a significant increase in the serum HDL-cholesterol level. The low-protein diet was associated with a significant reduction in the serum LDL-cholesterol level. The low-protein diet was associated with a significant reduction in the serum triglyceride level. The low-protein diet was associated with a significant reduction in the serum TGF-β1 level. The low-protein diet was associated with a significant reduction in the serum IL-6 level.

1. The studies aimed to define the role of tamsulosin as an adjunctive therapy after ESWL for renal and ureteral stones, including in pediatric patients.

2. The studies evaluated the effect of tamsulosin on stone clearance, analgesic requirements, and the development of steinstrasse (a complication of SWL) after SWL for renal and ureteral stones.

3. One study specifically included 120 children with a single renal pelvic stone, where one group received tamsulosin and paracetamol, while the other group received only paracetamol after SWL. The study found that tamsulosin as an adjunctive therapy improved stone clearance.

4. Overall, the context suggests that the studies were designed to assess the potential beneficial role of tamsulosin as an adjunct to SWL in the management of renal and ureteral calculi.

Therefore, based on the presented information, there appears to be evidence supporting the use of tamsulosin as an adjunctive therapy after shock wave lithotripsy for the treatment of renal and ureteral calculi."

- The first paragraph suggests that employees working overtime were not more likely to experience adverse physical or mental health, presenteeism, or disability outcomes. However, those working 60+ hours were more likely to report new injuries and diagnoses, though these effects were overwhelmed by prior health, demographics, and compensation type.

- The secondary analyses of a longitudinal employee panel found that average hours worked during spring 2001 were not consistently associated with health, safety, and productivity outcomes spanning the following year.

- The broader literature suggests that job strain may be associated with various diseases and increased mortality, but there is little long-term data available from prospective studies.

- In a separate study on pregnant women, long working hours (>70 hours per week) were associated with increased odds of subfecundity (reduced fertility), especially when both partners worked long hours.

So in summary, the evidence is mixed - long workhours do not appear to consistently impact health, safety, and productivity based on the first two study descriptions, but there are some indications that very long hours (60+ or 70+) could increase certain adverse outcomes like injuries and subfecundity. More research would be needed to conclusively determine the impacts at a heavy manufacturer specifically."
